## This Presentation layer

This layer contains all the UI and external interfaces.
Here we define the web projects like a Web API or a Web App.

In this project this layer is going to be a Web Api and a Web App
made with the maven web Archetype.

It would be a Spring project, or even and SPA front end as well.
